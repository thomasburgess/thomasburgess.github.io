# Milü

## Rational approximations to $\pi$

The fractions 22/7 and 355/113 are both common approximations of $\pi$. The latter is so important it even has a name, 
[Milü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC). But why are these two common, how good are they, and how can they be improved?

The relative error can indicate how good the approximations are:
\\[
    \left|1-\frac{22}{7}/\pi\right|=4.02\cdot10^{-4},\quad \left|1-\frac{355}{113}/\pi\right|= 8.49\cdot10^{8}\,.
\\]
For 355/133 that is 3.141592**9**, meaning 6 digits of information giving 7 correct decimals.
Impressive, and known for about $\sim$2500 years! This is much more efficient representation 
than my favourite mnemonic device [^hawkesworth_1931]

       8        9         7       9

which is 15 words and 77 characters (excluding space and commas), as compared to 2 numbers and 6 digits.

## Improving approximations

Another question is: why are these so popular? A naive approach to find fractions would be to try to improve a simple guess of $\frac{i}{j}$ by increasing $i$ or $j$ so that the ratio goes to $\pi$. To reduce noise, print results when $\delta=\|i/j-\pi\|$ reaches a new record low.

Here is a python script that implements the naive method.

```python
def print_best(
    v: float = math.pi, i: int = 2, j: int = 1, best: float = math.pi, n: int = 1000
):
    frac = i / j
    q = 0
    print("[iterations, improvement]: numerator/denominator=fraction rel.error improvement") 
    for p in range(1, n):  # Search for n improvements
        i += frac < math.pi  # Increase i...
        j += frac >= math.pi  # ... or j
        frac = i / j  # Update fraction
        delta = abs(1-frac/v)
        if delta < best:  # Improvement found
            best = delta
            q += 1
            print(f"[{p}, {q}]: {i}/{j}={frac} {delta}")
```

This works, but many it tests many redundant fractions such as 3/1, 6/2, and 12/4. 

Here is the output for the first 15 improvements over 1/2:

```
The 4th improvement is 22/7, and the 14th improvement is 355/113. These were reached within the first 500 iterations, the next improvement doesn't come until iteration 68764. This approximation 52163/16604 is only a marginal improvement, but adding 4 new digits of information. In the series of improvements, the numerators follow [A063674](https://oeis.org/A063674) in OEIS, and the denominators follow [A063673](https://oeis.org/A063673).


Looking at the percent improvement in relative error (`1-current/previous %`) , the largest jumps (excluding the initial guess 3/1) are at 22/7 with 94.9570% and at 355/113 at 99.6794%. The next two improvements above 90% are 
```
[7144381, 169]: 5419351/1725033=3.1415926535898153 7.105427357601002e-15 94.4780%

```
Here, this approach runs into floating point accuracy issues, and the search until 1 billion iterations took around 5 minutes to execture.

## A better algorithm

Next question, is there a more efficient way to find rationals that approximate $\pi$? The two main inefficiencies is not only considering reduced rationals, and trying many ratios before finding an improvement. A better approach is using a [Stern-Brocot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree) tree[#graham_1994] is an infinite binary search tree containing all rational numbers in order.

## Conclusion

The Milü is an excellent approximation, it uniquely predicts more digits than it contains. The road I went down here requires knowledge of $\pi$ to approximate it, I'm not certain how 355/133 first was discovered, but it's an impressive feat.
