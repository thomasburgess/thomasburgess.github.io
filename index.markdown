# Welcome to my [blog](blog/).

This is the personal blog of physicist and data scientist Thomas T Burgess. 
Here I will post stuff that I have been tinker with. Typically this means something 
about geometry, math, python, or statistics.

## About me

Iâ€™m a Swedish Experimental Particle Physicist turned a Data Scientist.
I did my PhD research on [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) for
 [Stockholms Univeristet](https://www.su.se/) and then on
[ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) as a PostDoc/Researcher at 
[Universitet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no). 
Since then, I headed research at an indoor navigation startup (now acquired by ESRI),
was a senior data scientist at tourism startup TourRadar, headed the data department at 
health tech startup Bloom Diagnostics, and currently a principal data scientist at 
Refurbed in beautiful Vienna, Austria.
