## Introduction

Recently, I blogged about 
[Mersenne prime numbers]({% post_url 2024-10-26-mersenne %}). 
Today, I saw the announcement of 
[Say The Prime](https://saytheprime.com/). 
Of course I will join the effort! 

The goal of _Say The Prime_ is to have people say all the 41 million
digits of the 52nd Mersenne prime number on a YouTube Playlist. At a
rate of 2 primes per second, that is about 8 months of content -
impressive! 

## My digits

I was assigned the 419 digits 3772 until 4190, so I had 
to record myself saying:

```
84899 16752 24758 02289 14833 92952 58929
01292 81228 73739 22338 93368 46330 97159
54800 52022 47750 09676 45100 06799 89178

27620 16319 14172 56912 69335 15740 70997
34236 57222 21157 27736 00389 36533 4278
```

## Process

I recorded my voice right into Logic, not remembering to record a 
video. Recording and editing was quite annoying, so I decided to take
the audio and put a vidoe to it. I used 
[Hedron](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hedron/id1552617460) for
a quick animation of a dodecahedron made out of (hidden) dodecahedra and 
metabidiminished icosahedra, which is quite unrelated to primes, but looks nice enough!
