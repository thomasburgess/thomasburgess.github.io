# Advent of Code 2022

I will do this years [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in python. I've done this a few times before, let's see how many days I manage this round :D This blog contains spoilers, and all code I used, use it responsibly.

## Day 1 - Counting calories

Lines in a group have a single integer, blank lines separate groups.

{% details Click to expand `example data` python code... %}
```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```
{% enddetails %}


`readsums` parses the data, aggregates groups, and returns the list of sums.

{% details Click to expand `readsums` python code... %}
```python
def readsums(path):
    result = [0]  # Start with single empty sum
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            if not line.strip():
                result.append(0)  # Add new empty sum
                continue
            result[-1] = result[-1] + int(line)
    return result
```
{% enddetails %}

**Part 1** 

Task: Find the group with the largest sum.

Solution: Take the maximum of the list of sums

```python
max(readsums("day01_input.txt"))
```

**Part 2** 

Task: Find the three largest groups. 

Solution: Sort the list and summing the last 3 items:

```python
sum(sorted(readsums("day01_input.txt"))[-3:])
```

## Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors


Data: rows with games, the first column is the opponent move, and the second is the player move.

Move encoding: Rock, paper, and scissors is A, B, C for opponent, and X, Y, Z for player.

{% details Click to expand example data... %}
```
A Y
B X
C Z
```
{% enddetails %}

`readstrats` parses the data and converts character representation to 0, 1, 2

{% details Click to expand `readstrats` python code... %}
```python
def readstrats(path: str) -> list[int]:
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        return [
            (ord(i) - ord("A"), ord(j) - ord("X"))
            for i, j in (x.split() for x in f.readlines())
        ]
```
{% enddetails %}

**Part 1** 

Task: Count score for rock paper scissors games.

Score: Player move (1 for rock, 2 for paper, and 3 for scissors), plus 0 for loss, 3 for draw and 6 for win.

The `score` function computes the score for a single game:

{% details Click to expand `score` python code... %}
```python
def score(i, j):
    return j + 1 + [[3, 0, 6], [6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3]][j][i]
```
{% enddetails %}

With this the total score is

```python
sum(score(i, j) for i, j in readstrats("day02_input.txt"))
```

**Part 2**

Task: count score as above but now the second column states X=loss, Y=draw, Z=win.

Using `transform` the second column is transformed to the old format:

{% details Click to expand `transform` python code... %}
```python
def transform(i, j):
    return [[2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0]][j][i]
```
{% enddetails %}

and then the total score is

```python
sum(score(i, transform(i, j)) for i, j in readstrats("day02_input.txt"))
```

## Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganization

Each row of data is a rucksack with a string of characters `[a-zA-Z]`. 

{% details Click to expand example data... %}
```

jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
```
{% enddetails %}

Each character corresponds to a priority: a=1,..., z=27, A=27,..., Z=52.

{% details Click to expand `priority` python code... %}
```python
def priority(c: chr) -> int:
    return (ord(c) - ord("A") + 27) if c.isupper() else (ord(c) - ord("a") + 1)
```
{% enddetails %}

With this sack data is read with `readsacks`.

{% details Click to expand `readsacks` python code... %}
```python
def readsacks(path: str)->list[list[int]]:
    result = []
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            result.append(list(map(priority, line.strip())))
    return result
```
{% enddetails %}

**Part 1**

Task: sum priority of items unique in first and second half of rucksack. 

Part 1 is solved by summing the set intersections of the first and second part of the sacks:

{% details Click to expand `part1` python code... %}
```python
def part1(sacks: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    return sum(
        map(lambda x: sum(set(x[: len(x) // 2]).intersection(x[len(x) // 2 :])), sacks)
    )

```
{% enddetails %}


**Part 2**

Task: sum priority of items unique to three consecutive rucksacks.

This part is solved by summing the intersections of  consecutive sacks, as follows:

{% details Click to expand `part2` python code... %}
```python
def part2(sacks: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    return sum(
        map(
            lambda x: sum(
                set(sacks[x]).intersection(sacks[x + 1]).intersection(sacks[x + 2])
            ),
            range(0, len(sacks), 3),
        )
    )
```
{% enddetails %}

## Day 4
