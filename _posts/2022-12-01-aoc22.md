# Advent of Code 2022

I will do this years [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in python. I've done this a few times before, let's see how many days I manage this round :D This blog contains spoilers, and all code I used, use it responsibly.

## Day 1 - Counting calories

Lines in a group have a single integer, blank lines separate groups.

{% details Click to expand `example data` python code... %}
```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```
{% enddetails %}


`readsums` parses the data, aggregates groups, and returns the list of sums.

{% details Click to expand `readsums` python code... %}
```python
def readsums(path):
    result = [0]  # Start with single empty sum
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            if not line.strip():
                result.append(0)  # Add new empty sum
                continue
            result[-1] = result[-1] + int(line)
    return result
```
{% enddetails %}

**Part 1** 

Task: Find the group with the largest sum.

Solution: Take the maximum of the list of sums

```python
max(readsums("day01_input.txt"))
```

**Part 2** 

Task: Find the three largest groups. 

Solution: Sort the list and summing the last 3 items:

```python
sum(sorted(readsums("day01_input.txt"))[-3:])
```

## Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors


Data: rows with games, the first column is the opponent move, and the second is the player move.

Move encoding: Rock, paper, and scissors is A, B, C for opponent, and X, Y, Z for player.

{% details Click to expand example data... %}
```
A Y
B X
C Z
```
{% enddetails %}

`readstrats` parses the data and converts character representation to 0, 1, 2

{% details Click to expand `readstrats` python code... %}
```python
def readstrats(path: str) -> list[int]:
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        return [
            (ord(i) - ord("A"), ord(j) - ord("X"))
            for i, j in (x.split() for x in f.readlines())
        ]
```
{% enddetails %}

**Part 1** 

Task: Count score for rock paper scissors games.

Score: Player move (1 for rock, 2 for paper, and 3 for scissors), plus 0 for loss, 3 for draw and 6 for win.

The `score` function computes the score for a single game:

{% details Click to expand `score` python code... %}
```python
def score(i, j):
    return j + 1 + [[3, 0, 6], [6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3]][j][i]
```
{% enddetails %}

With this the total score is

```python
sum(score(i, j) for i, j in readstrats("day02_input.txt"))
```

**Part 2**

Task: count score as above but now the second column states X=loss, Y=draw, Z=win.

Using `transform` the second column is transformed to the old format:

{% details Click to expand `transform` python code... %}

```python
def transform(i, j):
    return [[2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0]][j][i]
```

{% enddetails %}

and then the total score is

```python
sum(score(i, transform(i, j)) for i, j in readstrats("day02_input.txt"))
```

## Day 3

**NOT YET**
