Hi,

I’m Thomas Burgess, welcome to the first post of my blog. 
I’m a Swedish Experimental Particle Physicist turned data scientist. 
I did my research on [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/)
for [Stockholms Univeristet](https://www.su.se/) and 
[ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) for [Universitet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no). 
Since then, I headed research at an indoor navigation startup acquired by ESRI,
was a senior data scientist at tourism startup TourRadar, and at health tech startup
Bloom Diagnostics, and currently head of data science at Refurbed in beautiful Vienna, 
Austria.

Today, I’ve set this thing blog up with 
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
for more details read the 
[Blog setup post]({% post_url 2021-06-12-Blog-setup %}). I hope to share some 
of the things I learn and do (from time to time). In the process, I also 
figured out how to put something in my 
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/thomasburgess).

The blog source with content is open and viewable in its 
[repository](https://github.com/thomasburgess/thomasburgess.github.io).
If you find anything useful and want to use, copy, or modify it, tell me 
about it and consider crediting me - all in the spirit of

Enjoy reading!
