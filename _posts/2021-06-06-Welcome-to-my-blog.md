Hi,

I’m Thomas Burgess, welcome to the first post of my blog. 
I’m a Swedish Experimental Particle Physicist turned data scientist. 
I did my research on [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/)
for [Stockholms Univeristet](https://www.su.se/) and [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/)
for [Universitet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no). 
Since then, I was head of research at an indoor navigation startup, 
senior data scientist at a tourism startup. Currently, I’m working in a 
health tech startup in beautiful Vienna, Austria.

Today, I’ve set this thing blog up with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
for more details read the [Blog setup post]({% post_url 2021-06-12-Blog-setup %}) 
I hope to share some of the things I learn and do (from time to time). 
In the process, I also figured out how to put something in my 
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/thomasburgess).

The blog source with content is open and viewable in its 
[repository](https://github.com/thomasburgess/thomasburgess.github.io).
If you find anything useful and want to use, copy, or modify it, tell me 
about it and consider crediting me - all in the spirit of

Enjoy reading!
