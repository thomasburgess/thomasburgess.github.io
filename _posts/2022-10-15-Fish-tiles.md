## The fish tile

A fish tile is shown in [Figure 1.](#figure-1) It is remarkably fun to play with! It is formed by two equilateral pentagons - the regular pentagon head, and the pentagonal crescent tail. The tail opening angle is 108 degrees so it fits a regular pentagon, while the angle between the head and tail is 144 degrees and fits a regular decagon.

{% endfigure %}

## Fish rings

Two regular pentarings of five fish are shown in [Figure 2.](#figure-2) 
In the first one, heads connect to the side of the tail forming a central star, and in the second one, heads go inside the tail to form a pentagon. I think these are the only possible pentarings of fish.

{% endfigure %}

Similarly, there are decarings, shown in [Figure 3.](#figure-3). 
First a decagon formed by tiling heads in 5.5.10 vertices, next a star is formed by putting heads together, and finally a large pentagon is formed by flipping the heads in the star tiling.

{% endfigure %}

## Tiling the plane

By making concentric pentarings, all of the plane except the central pengagon can be tiled, as shown in [Figure 4.](#figure-4). However, by tiling fishes head to tail on straight lines tilings over the full plane can be achived, shown in [Figure 5.](#figure-5)

{% endfigure %}

## Big tiling

Finally, in [Figure 6.](#figure-6), is a tiling (with holes) using the pentaring from [Figure 1.](#figure-1).
