description: Building a tree from a directory in python and how to print it
---

_In which I made two snippets for my trees._


## Background

Recently, I had to write a python script that transforms incoming data organizsed in a folder structure.
For this, I needed both a simple python representation and an easy way to print the data. 

Consider a project which collects sightings of Bigfoot, Nessie,
and Yeti as `.csv` files for each day when there was a sighting.
As seen in [Figure 1](#figure-1), the data is organized into folders 
by cryptid and month.

{% figure [caption:"Figure 1: Folder structure"] %}
![](/assets/images/2021-07-18/tree_hack_folder.png){: #figure-1 width="25%" alt="Folder strucutre"}
{% endfigure %}

In my terminal, I'd show the structure with [tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/) 
or [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd). In python, I could use 
[treelib](https://treelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
However, terminal tools don't fit my actual needs, 
and for python, it feels excessive with a whole library for such a simple thing.
Time to reinvent the wheel...

## Building a tree from a directory

I python version 3.4 or later, [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) is included, 
which can get directory contents by [globbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).
For instance:
```python
list(Path("data/").glob("**/*.csv"))
``` 
gives 
```python
[PosixPath('data/nessie/2021-04/2021-04-03-sighting.csv'), PosixPath('data/nessie/2021-02/2021-02-21-sighting.csv'), ...
```
Note: this approach may fail for large directory trees, and not sure what happens if there are circular links in the tree.
A simple way to get a tree representation without any classes is to use a dictionary `{"root": children}`. 
Here, `children` is another dictionary. For leaf nodes such as the `.csv` files, set the value to an 
empty dictionary. 
```python
{'data': {'nessie': {'2021-04': {'2021-04-03-sighting.csv': {}, ...} , ...}, ...}}
```
putting this together gives the following python snippet

```python
from typing import Any, Dict
from pathlib import Path


def path_tree(path: Path, pattern: str = "**/*") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Build tree from path

    Example:
        path_tree(".", "**/*.csv")
        >>> {'directory': {'file1.csv': {}, 'sub_directory': {'file2.csv': {}}}}

    Args:
        path (Path): Path to start search from
        pattern (str, optional): Pattern to glob all reports

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Dict of directories and report files
    """
    tree: Dict[Any, Any] = {}
    for p in Path(path).glob(pattern):
        t = tree
        for q in p.relative_to(Path(path)).parts:
            t[q] = t.get(q, {})  # if q != p[-1] else True)
            t = t[q]
    return tree
```

## Pretty printing a tree

True its batteries-included philosophy, python comes with a [pretty-printer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html):

```python
>>> pprint.pprint(a)
{'data': {'bigfoot': {'2021-01': {'2021-01-07-sighting.csv': {}},
                      '2021-03': {'2021-03-04-sighting.csv': {}, 
                      ....
```
This often is good enough. However, I want something more tree-like so let's add a basic visualization using 
[box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character). Here, I recursively loops through 
all dictionaries while remembering where to put `│`. As with glob, for large and highly nested trees (or cyclic content) this
could perform poorly - but for most uses, it's perfect.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List
def tree_to_str(tree: Dict[Any, Any], b: List[bool] = []) -> str:
    """Make string from tree

    Example:
        tree_to_str({'directory': {'file1.csv': {}, 'sub_directory': {'file2.csv': {}}}})
        >>> directory
            ├─ file1.csv
            └─ sub_directory
               └─ file2.csv

    Args:
        tree (Dict[Any, Any]): Dict with dicts
        b (List[bool], optional): stack to remember pipes

    Returns:
        str: String representation
    """
    s = ""
    for i, (k, v) in enumerate(tree.items()):
        s += (
            "".join(["  │" if q else "   " for q in b]) + (
                "  └" if i == len(tree) - 1 else "  ├") + f"─ {k}\n"
        )
        b.append(i < len(tree) - 1)
        s += tree_to_str(v, b)
        b.pop()
    return s
```

## Putting it all together

```python
>>> print(str_tree(path_tree(".", "**/*.csv")))
└─ data
   ├─ nessie
   │  ├─ 2021-04
   │  │  └─ 2021-04-03-sighting.csv
   │  └─ 2021-02
   │     ├─ 2021-02-21-sighting.csv
   │     └─ 2021-02-01-sighting.csv
   ├─ bigfoot
   │  ├─ 2021-01
   │  │  └─ 2021-01-07-sighting.csv
   │  └─ 2021-03
   │     ├─ 2021-03-27-sighting.csv
   │     ├─ 2021-03-04-sighting.csv
   │     └─ 2021-03-07-sighting.csv
   └─ yeti
      └─ 2021-04
         ├─ 2021-04-29-sighting.csv
         └─ 2021-04-14-sighting.csv
```

Great! - just like the `tree` in the command line. And all with just in two simple functions. Like anything on this site, use these snippets as you please at your own risk, and feel free to credit me when you do it.
